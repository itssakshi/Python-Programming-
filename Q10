Write a function that takes a sentence as input from the 
user and calculates the frequency of each letter. Use a 
variable of dictionary type to maintain the count.

def frequencies():
    '''
    Prints the frequency of each letter in a sentence.
    '''
    freq = dict()
    sentence = input('Enter a Sentence: ')
    for letter in sentence:
        if not letter.isalpha():
            continue
        if letter not in freq:
            freq[letter] = 1
        else:
            freq[letter] += 1

    print('Frequencies: ')
    for letter in freq:
        print(f'{letter} => {freq[letter]}')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    frequencies()
