'''
Consider a showroom of electronic products, where there are various salesmen.
Each salesman is given a commission of 5%, depending on the sales made per 
month. In case the sale done is less than 50000, then the salesman is not 
given any commission. Write a function to calculate total sales of a salesman 
in a month, commission and remarks for the salesman. Sales done by each 
salesman per week is to be provided as input. Use tuples/list to store data
of salesmen.
Assign remarks according to the following criteria:
    Excellent: Sales >=80000
    Good: Sales>=60000 and <80000
    Average: Sales>=40000 and <60000
    Work Hard: Sales < 40000
